music ill talk about the history of convolutional neural networks and i call this part of history as cats and itll become obvious why i call it soso around one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine who billion weasel did this famous experiment there still i think you could see some videos of it on youtube where theres this cat and it was a screen in front of it and ill screen there are these lines being displayed at different locations and in different orientation so its a slanted horizontal vertical and so on and there are some electrodes fitted to the cat and they were measuring trying to measure that which parts of brain actually respond to different visual stimuli its if you show it a stimulus at a certain location theres a different part of the brain fire and so on its oh and one of the things of outcomes of the study was that that different neurons in brain fire only different types of stimuli its not that all neurons in brain always fire any kind of visual stimuli that you give to them right so this is essentially roughly the idea behind convolutional neural networks starting from something known as neurocognitive which was proposed way back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty you could think of it as a very primitive convolutional neural network im sure that most of you have now read about or heard about convolutional neural networks but something very similar to it was proposed way back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty and what we know as the modern car emulation the neural networks maybe i think yan li kun is someone who proposed them way back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine and he was interested in using them for the task of handwritten digit recognition and this was again in the context of postal delivery services it so a lot of pin codes get written or phone numbers get written on the postcards and theres a requirement to read them automatically so that they can be the letters or postcards can be separated into different categories according to the postcard and according the postal code and so on its so or the pin code so thats where this interest was there and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine was when this convolutional neural networks were first proposed or used for the stars and then over the years several improvements were done to that and in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight this now how famous data set the emulous data set which is used for teaching deep neural networks courses or even for initial experiments with various neural network based networks this is one of the popular data sets which is used in this field and this was again released way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight and even today even for mykos i use it for various assignments and so on so its interesting that an algorithm which was inspired by an experiment on cats is today used to detect cats and we do of course among other various other things is just im just jokingly saying this music you
