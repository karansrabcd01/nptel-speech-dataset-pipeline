music hello everyone welcome to lecture one of cs seven zero one five which is the course on deep learning todays lecture is going to be a bit non technical were not going to cover any technical concepts we only going to talk about a brief or partial history of deep learning so we hear the terms artificial neural networks artificial neurons quite often these days and i just wanted you take you through the journey of where does all this originate from and this history contains several spans across several fields not just computer science we will start with biology then talk about something in physics then eventually come to computer science and so on right so with that lets start so just some acknowledgments and disclaimers so i have taken a lot of this material from the first paper which i have mentioned on the bullet and there might still be some errors because its dates as black as one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-one so maybe i have got some of the facts wrong so feel free to contact me if you think some of these portions need to be corrected and it would be good if you could provide me appropriate references for these corrections so lets start with the first chapter which is on biological neurons as i said it spans several fields so well start with biology and i will first talk about the brain and neurons within the brain right so way back in one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-one one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-three around that time joseph von gaillarde actually proposed that the nervous system our nervous system is a single continuous network as opposed to a network of many discrete cells right so his idea was that this is one gigantic cell sitting in our nervous system and its not a network of discrete cells and this theory was known as the reticular theory right and around the same time there was this some breakthrough or some dis some progress in staining techniques where camillo golgi discovered that a chemical reaction that will allow you to examine the neurons new neurons or the nervous tissue right so he was looking at this nervous tissue using some staining technique and by looking at what you see in this figure on the right hand side the yellow figure even he concluded that this is just once single cell and not a network of discrete cells right so he was again a proponent of reticular theory so this is about camilla corgi and then interestingly santiago kayal he used the same technique with gaul he proposed and he studied the same tissue and he came up with the conclusion that this is not a single cell this is actually a collection of various discrete cells which to get the forms and network so it is a network of things as opposed to a single cell there right so thats what his theory was and this was eventually came to be known as the neuron doctrine although this was not consolidated in the form of a doctrine by kayal that was done by this gentleman so he coined the term neuron so now today when you think about art here about artificial neural networks or artificial neurons the term neuron actually originated way back in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-one and this gentleman was responsible for coining that and he was also responsible for consolidating the neuron doctrine so already as you saw on the previous slide chirality proposed it but then over the years many people bought this idea and this guy was responsible for consolidating that into a neuron doctrine interestingly he is not only responsible for coining the term neuron he is also responsible for coining the term chromosome so two very important terms were coined by this one person right so now heres a question right so around one thousand, nine hundred and six when it was time to give the nobel prize in medicine what do you think which of these two proponents say there are two theories one is reticular theory which is a single cell and then theres this neuron doctrine which is a collection of cells our collection of neurons that a nervous system is a collection of neurons so what do you think which of these two guys who are proponents of these two different theories who would have got the actual nobel prize for medicine so interestingly it was given to both of them so till one thousand, nine hundred and six in fact way later till one thousand, nine hundred and fifty also this debate was not completely sad settled and then the committee said okay both of these are interesting pieces of work we yet dont know what really actually what the situation is actually but these conflicting ideas have a place together and so the nobel prize was actually given to both of them and this led to a history of some kind of controversies between these two times scientists and so on and this debate surprisingly was settled way later in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty and not by progress in biology as such but by progress in a different field so this was with the advent of electron microscopy so now it was able to see this at a much better scale and by looking at this under a microscope it was found that actually there is a gap between these neurons and hence its not a one single cell its actually a collection or a network of cells with a clear gap between them or some connections between them which are now known as synapses right so this was when the debate was settled so now why am i talking about biology why am i telling you about biological neuron and so on right so this is what we need to understand so there has always been interested in understanding how the human brain works from a biological perspective at least and around this time the debate was more or less settled that we have this our brain is a collection of many neurons and they interact with each other to help us do a lot of complex processing that we do on a daily basis right right from getting up in the morning and deciding what do we want to do today taking decisions performing computations and various complex things that our brain is capable of doing right now their interest is in seeing if you understand how the brain works can we make an artificial model for that right so can we come up with something which can simulate how our brain works and whats that model and how do we make a computer do that or how do we make a machine do that so thats why i started from biological neurons to take the inspiration from biology music music
